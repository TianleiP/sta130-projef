## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
library(tidyverse)
```
```{r}
library(rhdf5)
header <- h5ls("STA130_APOGEE.h5")
wavelength <- "STA130_APOGEE.h5" %>% h5read("wavelength") %>% as_tibble()
wavelength
```

```{r}
a <- c(0, 1)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
